**Download Code Editor**<br>
I assume you already have a code editor installed. I recommend using Visual Studio Code.<br>

**Make use of GitHub**<br>
Go to your GitHub account (or sign up if you don’t have one). Then, create a new repository and add two branches: backend and frontend.<br>

**Clone your repository**<br>
I’ve synced my GitHub account with Visual Studio Code so I can easily clone, push, pull, and more. I recommend doing the same to make your workflow easier.<br>

**Checkout/Switch Branch**<br>
I assume you’ve already cloned the repository. Now, open your terminal and type the following:
```bash
git checkout backend

git branch

Output:
     main
     frontend
    * backend
```

You may now go to the **Backend folder**.<br>

Just a reminder: always be curious. Search everything — how to do things, how it works, how to become a pro-grammer.
